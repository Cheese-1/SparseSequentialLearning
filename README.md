# Subspace Learning with Gaussian Processes for Sparse Contextual Bandits

This repository includes implementations of various bandit algorithms and synthetic bandit environments.
This project was developed as part of the BSc Research Project offered by TU Delft during the study period 2024 Q4 
for the Sparse Sequential Learning project. This project is set to be archived with the conclusion of the project.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cheese-1/SparseSequentialLearning.git
cd my_project
```



## Usage
The ``configurations/simulation_config.json`` holds the parametrization of the bandit algorithm and bandit environments. 
 The bandit may be simulated by running the ``src/main.py`` python file. The generated log is available in the ``results/`` directory.
The visual presented in the Thesis paper are available in the ``generated_graphs/`` directory.
